# Reason Workshop

## Requirements

Before beginning this example, you should have completed the installation instructions in the root of the project. If you haven't yet, please do that now before coming back.

## Workshop

To run the workshop, run `npm run watch`. In a browser navigate to http://localhost:8080/problems/1 and follow the instructions from there. If any of this is unclear, please ask for help from your instructor or from anyone around you.

This project requires two ports to be free on your machine, 3000 and 8080. You can override these with the setting `SERVER_PORT` and `WEBPACK_PORT` like so:

```
# on linux / osx
SERVER_PORT=3000 WEBPACK_PORT=8080 npm run watch;
```

As you complete the problems you can continue on to the next one. If you find yourself becoming stuck, go to the relevant koan, and familiarise yourself with the material. Once you've done that, come back and continue trying to solve the problem.
